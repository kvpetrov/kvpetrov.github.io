## Blog Post Title From First Header

Subquery was introduced in Prometheus in 2019 and we started implementing the feature in FiloDB in 2020. The current integration branch is feature complete for subquery though some of its functionality depends on the new ANTLR based parser. In this post I will describe:
* the feature itself
* motivation to implement subquery in FiloDB
* limitations of the approach.

### What is subquery
something about subquery
```tsql
SELECT This, [Is], A, Code, Block -- Using SSMS style syntax highlighting
    , REVERSE('abc')
FROM dbo.SomeTable s
    CROSS JOIN dbo.OtherTable o;
```

### Motivation
Very often subqueries are used for alerting when we cannot use the metrics as is but need to transform it into smoother version of itself.

#### Limitations
The most straitforward way to implmenet subquery is to run multiple simple subqueries exactly as many times are there are steps in the subquery lookback.

```
for (int i=start; i<end; i+=step) {
  result += run_query(subquery, i)
}
return result
```
